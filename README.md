## m-digest

The name is inspired by t-digest and the implementation is likewise
inspired by t-digest. The t-digest has a few problems, the complexity
of the implementation and the variable memory requirement.

The m-digest tries to solve this problem by using a constant size
datastructure consisting of centroids where the middle centroids have
larger weights than the extrema centroids.
